# README

There are dotfiles that I customized among PC, Remote PC and computers in our lab.

# Feture

This repository contains about bash files, zsh files, vim files, and so on.

If you install them at first, run 'dotfileLinks.sh' to generate the links of dotfiles in your home directory.

# Notice

## __coc.nvim__

coc.nvim required vim(version > 8.2), and node(version > 12.x).

So, if you wanna install them, refer to URL1 and URL2 below.
